Angular library
--
  You do not need a project. Instead you need a workspace. It's an empty project 


Creating and Using Library 
--
  4 Steps 
  --
    Step 1
    --
      Create workspace. 
        ng new my-big-app --create-application=false 

    Step 2: 
    --
      Create a library
      cd my-big-app 
      ng g library my-weather-lib --prefix=mwl      (this is selector's prefix) 

    
    Step 3: 
    --
      create an angular app 
      ng g application weather-app-demo 

    Step 4: 
    ---
      Make use of the library in an angular app 
      i.e  make use of my-weather-lib in weather-app-demo

      Step 4.1) Take a build of library 
        ng build my-weather-lib 

      Step 4.2) use the above library  in weather-app-demo project 
        in app.module.ts of weather-app-demo 
        
        import { MyWeatherLibModule } from 'my-weather-lib';

        @NgModule({
          declarations: [
            AppComponent
          ],
          imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            AppRoutingModule,
            MyWeatherLibModule // use the library here 
          ],
          providers: [],
          bootstrap: [AppComponent]
        })

      Step 4.3) Now, in app.comp.html, use the selector of the library 
      
        <div>
          <h1>Demo of weather-app</h1>
          <mwl-my-weather-lib></mwl-my-weather-lib>
        </div>

      Step 4.4) Let's start the server from my-big-app 
        
        ng serve 
        then, check localhost:4200

 thats it...

  if you are modifying your library.. don't forget to build the library again.
  Note: if your library has http calls, you need to import 'HttpClientModule' in library's module.
  And If you do binding, *ngIf, *ngFor kinds of stuff, you need to import 'CommonModule' in library's module.



You can also create a tar archive file
TAR Archive file compressed using Gnu Zip (gzip) for the library

cd dist/my-weather-lib 
npm pack
After this is over, you can install the package using npm install cmd
cd .. 
cd ..
npm install ./dist/my-weather-lib/my-weather-lib-0.0.1.tgz

Then, find the above package inside node_modules folder 
Finally, don't forget to remove the entry in main tsconfig.json (workspace level file)

Restart your app and then check it.
